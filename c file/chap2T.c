/* There are some type of instructions in c language 
1. Arthematic Inst.
2. Control Inst.
3. Type Declaration Inst.

Type Decloaration Instruction.
Such as Int, float, etc .

Arthematic Instuctions
Such as +, -, *, / .            [There is no exponential operator in c lang.]

Control Instructions
Such as  a. Sequence Control Inst.
         b. Decision Control Imst.
         c. Loop Control Inst.
         d. Case Control Inst.
